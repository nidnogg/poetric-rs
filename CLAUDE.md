## Goals

 lets make a zola poetry blog that takes in markdown. i'd like it to refer to an obsidian vault. whenevr someone writes to a folder named publish, it publishes the md files.

- current obstacles:
- run process is broken. probably the first versino of claude.md wasn't fully executed. need to analyze potential churn
‚è∫ I'll help you create a Zola poetry blog that integrates with an Obsidian vault and publishes markdown files from a "publish" folder. Let me break this down into tasks.
## Design CSS Considerations
- Use lightweight, not too long animations with ease-in-out
- 0.377ms for everything. if it needs to be long, 5.77ms.
- opt for Gruvbox palette
- make it easy for me to change color palettes
- and hmmmm make it ux friendly. incorporate advanced ux and elegant design. time animations at 0.377ms if you use keyframes or something css animated.
- act like you're an awwwards designer lol. just make it usable for users.
